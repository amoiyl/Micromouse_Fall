	 * is massive and the wheels will start spinning at full speed in opposite directions to even back out.
	 *
	 * This code helps prevent that by reseting the encoder counts when any of the encoder values get too extreme.
	 * It also maintains the magnitude of the difference between the left and right encoders so that PID will work seamlessly.
	 *
	 * You may have to adjust it in the event you try to traverse more than 31000 encoder counts at once (~9 meters) without
	 * turning. But that'll be approximately never in Micromouse :)
