	 * set the motor speeds.
	 *
	 * For assignment 3.1: implement this function to get your rat to drive forwards indefinitely in a straight line. Refer to pseudocode
	 * example document on the google drive for some pointers
	 *
	 * TIPS (assignment 3.1): Create kPw and kDw variables, and use a variable to store the previous error for use in computing your
	 * derivative term. You may get better performance by having your kDw term average the previous handful of error values instead of the
	 * immediately previous one, or using a stored error from 10-15 cycles ago (stored in an array?). This is because systick calls so frequently
	 * that the error change may be very small and hard to operate on.
	 *
	 * For assignment 3.2: implement this function so it calculates distanceError as the difference between your goal distance and the average of
	 * your left and right encoder counts. Calculate angleError as the difference between your goal angle and the difference between your left and
	 * right encoder counts. Refer to pseudocode example document on the google drive for some pointers.
